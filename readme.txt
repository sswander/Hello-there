Hello!

index.html is my homepage.

This website is a little about me/ blog kind of site, mostly intended for people to see what i've been into. The content is limited due to little time given but the idea is there. Enjoy :)

You'll be able to find the usage of a grid system in any of the html files, all the pages use those.

The base CSS is seen in the forms in form.html and buttons in my modal screens in todo.html

The components (mainly glyphicons and panel) are seen in todo.html

The javascript items include carousel in index.html and modal screens in todo.html

Form validation can be seen in contact.js which is the script used in contact.html

jQuery effects can be found in index.js, media.js and contact.js
