				<h1 class="blog-title" id="meiji-kino-onsen">Meiji shrine, Kinokuniya, Onsen</h1>
				<h4 class="blog-date">10 December 2014</h4>
				<p><br>So this is a condensed form of a few of my trips so far, 
				because I didn't really have the time to update this site. I visited 
				Meiji shrine and boy it was so stunning. The long walks of rocks and 
				gravel road, surrounded by the yellow stretch of autumn trees... 
				to salvation in the shrine itself. I tried to wash my hands and rinse 
				my mouth in the well, got some omikuji and saw a shinto wedding! 
				How lucky I was. There were also these boards where people hang their 
				prayers on, and I thought this was especially cute.<br><br></p>
				
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img2.jpg" alt="prayer"></img>
				
				<p><br><br>Then the other day I also visited Shinjuku, and walked 
				around the shopping malls and discovered Kinokuniya, the book store. 
				Kinokuniya in Japanese looks nothing like like KINOKUNIYA. Instead 
				it was some string of kanjis, which really made it difficult for 
				me to recognise. But I found it, and I entered the 6-7ish storey 
				building of knowledge and stories and enlightenments... all in 
				Japanese. So of course I felt so outcast and I did not feel belonged 
				at all even though I like to be surrounded by books sometimes, until 
				I found the "foreign" section. There I found some my peace. The 
				shelves were filled of books I understand, and some of them even 
				really interesting.<br><br></p>
				
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img6.jpg" alt="book"></img>
				<p><br><b>At least they accept themselves for what they are. <br><br>
				Right?</b><br><br><br><br></p>
				
				<p>Also the other day I went to Ooedo Onsen (literally big edo onsen). 
				That was the first time I've been to any onsen and wow the experience 
				was so amazing. I dressed in yukata and enjoyed the snacks that were 
				sold there, and I mixed with about 40 other men in a big indoor hot 
				spring bath. That was my first time baring myself naked in front of 
				so many people, but strangely I didn't feel inferior or intimidated. 
				I figured out why though: because we're all asians.<br><br></p>
				
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img7.jpg" alt="onsen"></img>
				<p><br><b>I only took a picture of the front part of the building. 
				The rest are in videos which I won't reveal here *smugface*</b><br><br>
				
				I don't feel like typing anymore, so here are some random pictures 
				from throughout the days:<br><br><br><br></p>
				
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img3.jpg" alt="road"></img>
				<p><br><b>Some zebra crossing. I totally forgot why I took this in 
				the first place.</b><br><br><br><br></p>
				
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img8.jpg" alt="park"></img>
				<p><br><b>A random park at night. It was so tranquil but I couldn't take 
				any pic without flash because it was so dark. Even with flash it still couldn't 
				do justice to the real thing, but hey man, the camera had done its best.</b><br><br><br><br></p>
				
				<p>That's it. Till next time!<br><br></p>
				
				
				
				
				<h1 class="blog-title" id="ueno-zoo">Ueno zoo</h1>
				<h4 class="blog-date">5 December 2014</h4>
				<p><br>So I went to Ueno park to check out the zoo. I mean, I thought
				going to the zoo wasn't something that people will do when they visit
				Japan, so I was quite excited to be the so-called "different".<br><br>
				In itself though, Ueno zoo was a fun place to visit. The cold autumn 
				breeze really made the walk enjoyable, and I saw a lot of couples, 
				families and kids enjoying their time there. Of course I saw a lot of 
				animals (cause hey, it's a zoo) and here are some of their pictures:<br><br></p>
				
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img10.jpg" alt="leopard"></img>
				<p><br><b>The leopard which kept moving around. I gave up taking a  good 
				shot of it.</b><br><br><br><br></p>
				
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img5.jpg" alt="red panda"></img>
				<p><br><b>Red panda! One of my most favourite animal in the zoo. They're 
				small, but up close they can look majestic.</b><br><br><br><br></p>
				
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img4.jpg" alt="polar bear"></img>
				<p><br><b>Polar bear, one of the staples in every zoo.</b><br><br><br><br></p>
				
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img9.jpg" alt="chameleon"></img>
				<p><br><b>Water chameleon. It was genuinely hard to find at first, until it 
				started moving and we were all like "oh hey there it is!".</b><br><br><br><br></p>
				
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img11.jpg" alt="baboon"></img>
				<p><br><b>The esteemed baboon which didn't even wanna look my way. 
				Enjoy its back view.</b><br><br></p>
				
				<p>I also saw herons and other animals I can't really remember. For most of 
				it, I recorded videos instead of pictures, and I shall keep this blog at pictures 
				because uploading videos takes much more work. Enjoy these meanwhile!<br><br></p>
				
				
				
				
				
				<h1 class="blog-title" id="first-night">First night</h1>
				<h4 class="blog-date">3 December 2014</h4>
				<p><br>AND I've landed in Tokyo! I was so excited, recorded stuff in 
				Narita airport and got questioned by the security guard there (laughs)
				 I really practiced my Japanese then. I introduced myself the way I 
				 did in my Japanese classes, I laughed at myself in my mind. He let 
				 me off easy, and the trip from Narita to Tokyo (about 45 minutes with 
				 Narita express, an express train service to and fro Narita-Tokyo) and
				  the view was so nice! I did not take pictures of it sadly. I lugged 
				  my bulky and heavy luggage (WOW NOW I KNOW WHY IT'S CALLED LUGGAGE. 
				  BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO LUG IT. GET IT?) around and find my house that I
				  was staying at and settled down. <br><br>
				  After that I went for dinner at CoCo 
				  Ichibanya, the curry restaurant. The staff didn't understand English 
				  at all and I felt bad for making him feel nervous by speaking in 
				  English. Luckily he understood "Menu" so it was all good, 
				  I got my tummy filled and everybody was happy. Then I wanted to take 
				  a good walk around, but apparently my camera battery died so I had to
				   go back and replace it. 
				   <br><br>
				   When I went back, I met a roommate from 
				   Taiwan who introduced himself as Kufer. We talked in a mix of English, 
				   Chinese and Japanese, but we understood each other. He said he was 
				   gonna find food around, and asked if I wanted to tag along and I said 
				   why not! So I did, and took a walk from Kanda to Tokyo station while 
				   talking to him about stuff (in those 3 languages). The only picture 
				   I got was this blurry building of Takashimaya, which is the first out 
				   of two times I actually saw Takashimaya in Tokyo.<br><br></p>
				   
				<img class="blog-img" src="img/media/img1.jpg" alt="takashimaya"></img>
				
				<p><br><br>Again the night walk was fun mostly because of it was so 
				chilly. We saw tokyo station which looked so grand and pretty, and 
				the fact that it looks so different when looked from one of the 2 sides 
				(Marunouchi and Yaesu exits) just makes it even cooler!<br><br></p>
